      <h1>The 4 C's of Diamonds</h1>
      <p>When the GIA (Gemological Institute Of America) rates a diamond, they use the "4 C's": <strong>Color, Clarity, Cut, and Carat</strong>.  Not all diamonds are created equally, so it is important to understand what drives the value of a diamond.  Below you will find information as well as our recommendations on which "C's" to weigh more for different types of jewelry pieces.</p>
      <div class="container">
        <p class="four-c-column"><img src="/img/4-c-color.jpg" title="Color | Diamond" /><br />Diamond colors range from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow).  Colorless diamonds allow light to pass through easily, which creates a rainbow effect of color as it sparkles.  The less color a diamond has, the more valuable it is.  There are also fancy colors such as pink and intense yellow which are also beautiful and considered valuable.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Important for:</strong><br />Engagement Rings, Earrings<br /><strong>Less important for:</strong><br />Bracelets, Pendants</p>
        <p class="four-c-column"><img src="/img/4-c-clarity.jpg" title="Clarity | Diamond" /><br />Clarity refers to inclusions and blemishes found in the stone and graded by the GIA depending on their location, type, and extent. The clarity scale ranges from:<br /><strong>Flawless</strong> - no inclusions<br /><strong>VVS</strong> - very, very slightly included<br /><strong>VS</strong> - very slightly included<br /><strong>SI</strong> - slightly included<br /><strong>I</strong> - imperfect observable inclusions<br /><br /><strong>Important for:</strong><br/>Engagement Rings<br /><strong>Less important for:</strong><br />Earrings, Bracelets, Pendants</p>
        <p class="four-c-column"><img src="/img/4-c-cut.jpg" title="Cut | Diamond" /><br />The cut of a diamond refers to the following: proportions, symmetry and finish.  When you first get a raw diamond, you need a skilled cutter to accurately cut it to the appropriate proportions.  The better the cut, the better the diamond will handle light, leading to an amazing sparkle and brilliance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Important for:</strong><br />Everything</p>
        <p class="four-c-column"><img src="/img/4-c-carat.jpg" title="Carat | Diamond" /><br />The weight of a diamond is measured in carats. As a diamonds carat weight increases, so does its rarity and price. The carat-weight of a diamond is the easiest to measure and evaluate.  However, two equal carat-weight diamonds can have very different price points if  their cut, color, and clarity differ.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Important for:</strong><br />Matter of preference</p>
